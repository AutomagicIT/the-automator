We will work from co-working spaces in Austin - where we will wear company clothes with the place on sweatshirts and shirts just above where the chair back ends reads "Ask me how Tilt can replace all your website testing."

Our devs will also perform "Engineer on demand, like AWS but for engineering" and "Superpower your teams with our AI mentorship" - so we are going to co-working spaces, and rotate every two weeks to a month - getting tilt introduce and integrated into the companies at the workspace.

And we repeat. When we have exchausted Austin, we go to San Diego and repeat, then to LA and repeat, the the prize! San Francisco and we get EMBEDDED deep in all the incubator teams like those at YC. We want the incubator execs to know about tilt before we even pitch them, because they have teams in their incubators using and loving Tilt!

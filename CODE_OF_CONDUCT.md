# Code of Conduct

## Our Philosophy

**This project is not your political playground.**

We ask that everyone be respectful - the world is a big place and very few people believe what you and your culture believes. Live and let live. Keep the politics on X.

This is a technical project focused on computer automation and AI tooling. We're here to build great software, not to advance political agendas of any kind.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* **Focusing on technical discussions** and constructive feedback
* **Being respectful** of differing technical opinions and experience levels
* **Accepting constructive criticism** gracefully
* **Focusing on what is best for the community** and the project
* **Showing empathy** towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* **Political discussions or activism** of any kind
* **Harassment, trolling, or inflammatory comments**
* **Personal attacks** or insults
* **Publishing private information** without explicit permission
* **Spam, off-topic content,** or excessive self-promotion
* **Any conduct that disrupts** the technical focus of the project

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories, issues, and pull requests
- Discussions and comments
- Documentation and wikis
- Any other communication channels associated with the project

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to:

- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions
- Ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors deemed inappropriate
- Take any other actions deemed necessary to maintain the technical focus of the project

## Reporting

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, with modifications to emphasize our focus on technical collaboration and explicitly exclude political discussions.

**Remember**: We're here to build amazing automation tools. Let's keep our energy focused on that shared goal.
